# Discussions
The issues of this project are abused as a discussion forum for Open Tech.

Here you can discuss ideas for OpenTechBFG, general idTech4 related topics and even offtopic things.

If an idea discussed here gets to a point where we decide that it could/should be implemented in OpenTechBFG, we'll add a task with the relevant information in the OpenTechBFG issue tracker.

The goal is to keep the OpenTechBFG issue tracker clear and overseeable, so it only contains actual bugs and tasks we decided on doing.
